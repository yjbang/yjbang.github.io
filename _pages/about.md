I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Center for AI Research ([CAiRE](https://caire.hkust.edu.hk/)), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/)), superviced by [Prof. Pascale Fung](https://pascale.home.ece.ust.hk/). 

My research passion revolves around Natural Language Processing (NLP), delving into themes of << Value Alignment, Large Language Model (LLM) Evaluation, Responsible AI, and Safety in AI >>.

Honored with the Area Chair Award at AACL 2023, my [contributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04023) have earned a spot among the [Top 100 AI achievements (2022-2023)](https://www.benchcouncil.org/evaluation/ai/annual.html). I serve as a reviewer for prominent NLP conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL, ARR and Harvard Data Science Review.
